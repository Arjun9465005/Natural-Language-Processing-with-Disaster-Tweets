# Natural-Language-Processing-with-Disaster-Tweets
The "Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets" project was a competitive endeavor focused on classifying tweets related to disasters, determining whether each tweet pertained to a real disaster event or not. In this Kaggle competition, I aimed to develop a model that could accurately identify and predict relevant disaster information from social media posts. The challenge was to distinguish between real and non-real disaster tweets using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

Throughout the competition, I applied a variety of NLP methods, including text preprocessing, tokenization, and feature extraction, to convert raw tweet data into a structured format suitable for machine learning models. The dataset provided consisted of labeled tweets, which served as the foundation for training and validating the model. I experimented with different algorithms and fine-tuned hyperparameters to enhance the model's performance, striving for the highest possible accuracy.

Ultimately, my model achieved a significant milestone, placing 350th on the competition leaderboard. This position reflects the model's capability to effectively classify disaster-related tweets, demonstrating its potential utility in real-world disaster response scenarios. The project not only honed my skills in NLP and machine learning but also provided valuable insights into the challenges and complexities of working with unstructured text data in critical applications.
